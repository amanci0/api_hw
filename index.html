	<h1>Our Drinks</h1>
	<div id="data">Loading...</div>
	<div> 
		<p> I chose to source my data from The Cocktail DB, which provides recipes for different cocktails.</p>
		<p>I found this site through a Github page that compiles a list of public API's. Found <a href = "https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php" target ="_blank">here.</a></p>
		<p>I followed the AJAX template for the API request that we learned in class. It follows the 4 steps of setting up the request to the server, opening the file, firing off the request, and finally parsing through the data to return the info. I want. I chose to display the cocktails available that start with the letter "A", and inlcuded the main ingredient in their recipe.</p>
		<p>This API may be useful in the development of a site that provides a list of drinks such as a recipe reference. It may also be used to create a site that allows users to enter their available drink ingredients to find any potential recipes for cocktails they can make.</p>
